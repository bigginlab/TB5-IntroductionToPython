    "Learning how to fully use a programming language, especially for the first time, is a task which can easily take several months to achieve. Indeed, the Python programming language is rather vast and fully covering it would never be achievable within the timeframes allowed by this course. Instead this tutorial aims to offer a first impression on the basic concepts of Python programming. It is our hope that this will serve as an entry point towards further studies in both Python and other programming languages.\n",
    "The main objectives this tutorial covers are:\n",
    "1.\tUnderstanding how to execute Python code using Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tUnderstanding the basic Python object types\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tUnderstanding how to use operators to assign and manipulate variables\n",

    "\n",
    "4.\tGaining basic insights on bult-in Python functions and how to import external modules\n",

    "# Python programming - what and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python programming language is a general-purpose interpreted object-orientated programming language which has existed for over 30 years.  Originally developed by Guido van Rossum, the language has matured over the years into a incredibly large ecosystem with millions of developers. Python is not under the care of the Python Software Foundation and usually has yearly releases of the Python programming language, comprising of new features and bug fixes, with the latest release being python 3.10. More information on Python and its development process can be found here: https://www.python.org/\n",
    "This short course concentrates solely on the use of the Python programming language. One could rightly ask why Python and not one of the hundreds of other programming languages that currently exist?\n",
    "There are several reasons as to why this choice was made:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tPython has over recent years become a commonly used tool by scientists looking to rapidly create, explore and analyse data. Many existing scientific tools either exist purely in Python or offer Python interfaces (for example [alphafold](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold) or the biomolecular viewer [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/). It has therefore become important for many scientists to have a working understanding of how to use basic Python commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tPython is very flexible and easy to play with. In part due to its nature as an `interpreted language` (unlike languages like C++ and Fortran which are compiled language that require to be passed through a compiler before a computer can understand written code), it is easy to make modifications to code and directly see how it may affect outcomes. This does come at the cost of performance, with Python being slower than compiled languages, however there are many ways in which savvy programmers can go around this limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tPython is portable, free to use and open-source. Unlike programming language such as Matlab it does not require a paid license to operate. It also works equally well on any operating system, be it; Linux, Windows or MacOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tPython comes with an incredibly large ecosystem with many software packages to extend its usage. We unfortunately won’t be touching upon this in this tutorial, but there are many ways to extend Python, with tools such as NumPy for scientific computing (https://numpy.org/), scikit-learn for machine learning (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and matplotlib for drawing figures (https://matplotlib.org/). These massively expand the base utility of the Python programming language, allowing for complex tools and packages to be written.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, this tutorial does not aim to advocate for one programming language over any other. Indeed, each programming language has its own advantage and disadvantages based on the intended use case. With most programming languages having very similar core components and concepts, we hope that this primer to Python programming will serve useful for whichever programming language you many end up using in the future.\n"

    "# How to use this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to better demonstrate how the Python programming language works, we employ the use of Jupyter notebooks in this tutorial. [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are a useful way to interactively demonstrate python code in a clear and organised manner, whilst avoiding the need to write out files. It also allows us to run python in the cloud using tools such as Google Colab or Binder (see “running these notebooks at home” below). In practice, one may need to write out code to a file and run them directly through the command line, how to do this will not be covered by this tutorial, but do ask a demonstrator for more information if you are interested!\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are composed of a series of `cells` which can either contain text (such as this one) or code (which will usually have the words `In [ ]:` or just `[ ]:` next to them. You can type code in `cells` by clicking on them and typing whatever changes you want to make. Code cells can be used to run any valid Python code. To do this simply click on the cell and press the `Run` button on the toolbar above, or type `Shift + Enter`.\n",
    "Important note: All code executed is retained in the memory of the notebook. That means that if you `import` a module or declare a variable, these will be seen and can interact with code in cells executed at a later stage in other parts of the notebook. If things behave in a way that you do not expect, it is often worth checking that you did not declare a conflicting variable in another part of the notebook. If needs be the notebook can be cleared by navigating to `Kernel > Restart & Clear Output`, a further prompt will ask you if you wish to clear all outputs, pressing on this will return the notebook to a state where none of the cells have been run. When finished, a notebook should be shut down by clicking on `File > Close and Halt`.\n",

    "Instructions on starting the tutorial notebook in the Biochemistry computer lab will be provided on the day.

That being said, Google Colab has a slightly different interface from conventional Jupyter notebooks, and therefore requires you to read through its [“getting started documentation”](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index#scrollTo=-gE-Ez1qtyIA).\n",

    "This includes the above mentioned math libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the \"standard library\", there are also many amazing community driven packages, here is a non-exhaustive list of them:\n",
    "-\tNumPy (http://www.numpy.org/) and SciPy (https://www.scipy.org/) are excellent libraries that do a lot more that simple mathematical operations (like the Euclidean distance calculator above). These also interface very well with plotting libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tMatplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/) is the most commonly used plotting library available. It is simple, and can do a lot. Other plotting libraries, such as GGPlot (http://ggplot.yhathq.com/), SeaBorn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and Bokeh (https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tPandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a great library to manipulate data structures. Its ease of use makes it ideal to work with large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tMDAnalysis (https://www.mdanalysis.org/), MDTraj (http://mdtraj.org/1.9.0/), and PyTraj (https://github.com/Amber-MD/pytraj), are some of the libraries used to process Molecular Dynamics trajcetories and other files. These interface very well with NumPy and Pandas and Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tSciKit-Learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for machine learning in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tMPI4Py (http://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) allows Python scripts to be parallelised (run over multiple processors).\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tCython (http://cython.org/) allows you to write parts of your code in C/C++, making it very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each library will have its means of directly installing them, however keeping track of various installs and avoiding clashes between libraries can be quite tedious. We instead recommend that a package manager like conda be used instead.\n",
